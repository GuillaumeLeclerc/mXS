Description :
-------------

sminer extracts all sequences having a frequency greater than or equal to a minimum threshhold. Target (objective) items may be searched according to a confidence threshold and outputed (as "annotation rules").

Items may be form a hierarchy (subs) : then specialisation is indicated using "/" operator (e.g. if A/B and A/C are two items, and both subtypes of A). The hierarchy may be a forest. Take care not to mix targets and none targets within same tree.

Patterns of identical frequencies which are generalization one of each other are grouped together, and only maximal (or minimal) patterns are to be extracted.

Tagging French NEs using Etape model for lazy people:
-----------------------------------------------------

Install Treetagger on your machine and set its path in:
- bin/conf_machineExample.sh

Using command line, go into mxs root directory, and try:
$ echo "Le président Barack Obama a été à Dakar, au Sénégal, en juin 2013." | ./bin/tagEtapeModel.sh

(Very) Short how-to :
---------------------

This is an alpha release and I advise to contact me for installation / configuration / usage. My current problems are the availability of corpora for French, and adaptations of preprocessings (TreeTagger) for English. Anyway, let's write a very quick start guide.

This software requires:
- TreeTagger : http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger
- scikit-learn : http://scikit-learn.org/stable/

You may want to only tag texts. In that case, provide the correct path for TreeTagger in:
- bin/conf_machineExample.sh

Source this file and the the configuration for the NER model (learned for French over Etape corpus http://www.afcp-parole.org/etape.html):
$ . ./bin/conf_machineExample.sh
$ . ./bin/conf_conf_EtapeModel.sh

Try to tag a text (be patient, loading models may take a few minutes), e.g.:
$ echo "Le président Barack Obama a été en Afrique du Sud le 30 juillet 2013." | ./bin/tagSciKit.sh

For learning models over a specific corpus (and testing it), you'll advanced configuration. Make the pattern extractor:
$ make clean && make

Adapt configuration directives in:
- bin/conf_DatasetExample.sh 

As previously, source configuration files:
$ . ./bin/conf_machineExample.sh
$ . ./bin/conf_DatasetExample.sh

Then try the whole process:
$ ./bin/testCorpus.sh

Hopefully, the script testCorpus.sh is human-readable. In a few words, it should:
1 Pre-process corpora
2 Extract patterns from train corpus
3 Learn regression models using scikit-learn
4 Use models to tag test corpus

Ok, this is very minimal. Much more to come sooner or later, with an examplified dataset...
